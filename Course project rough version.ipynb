    "Slide 1 is an intro to neurotism and big 5 personality. Slide 2 is about methods, basically just making big multiple linear regression models then simplifying it. Slide 3 is about lifestyle changes, so sleep, excersice, and diet and how it affects neurotism, and slide 4 is about social connections and it's effects.\n",

    "## A curse - slide 1\n",
    "Have you ever felt that life was unfair? Well, for years scientists have studied how to predict people's lives. The 'big 5' personality scores for example, measures people on 5 categories which each correlate well with major differences throughout life. Neurotism is one of these big 5 measures, and it tracks how likely someone is to feel negative emotions. So, high neurotism could be something like a curse, a disposition to be sad and stressed all throught life. Studies have shown though, that change is possible, but mostly from changes in situation, which isn't exactly helpful to hear. And so i'd like to look into that, to see if there are any actions that can be taken to become a less neurotic, and thus more happy, person.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods - slide 2\n",
    "I tried to be systematic when searching for the most important changes. There are many variables and interactions are relatively un-important, so I decided to first break the variables into 3 categories: lifestyle, social, and results. In other words, it's a spectrum, easy changes in the day to day actions you take, changes in social situations and long term things to focus on, and, at least for our purposes, junk. Then I did multiple linear regression with a bunch of the variables in each category, filtering out the ones with high p values, and finally I narrowed down to some interesting variables. Here are the results: \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lifestyle findings - slide 3\n",
    "The main points I want to talk about are sleep and diet, since thats what I found to the have the lowest p values. I'll talk briefly about finding those variables and then show the p values and probably box plots for both variables. The take-away is that people who sleep more and try to eat more healthy foods are generally more happy and stable people. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Social findings - slide 4\n",
    "The main points I found are that talking to friends very often has a big effect, but anything less than that isn't noteworthy, and that helping others changes a lot. I don't really know if the helping others thing is really causation, or in other words if implementing it changes anything, but it makes for a good story so I'll focus on it. I'm also planning on making a box plot to show the difference.     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's kinda it. Below is some of the rough work I did, incase you want to use some of it. I'll have a decent presentation done for the video, but I'm not really happy with what's here so far"
