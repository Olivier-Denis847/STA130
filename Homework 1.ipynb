Without, only columns of integers were described and there were 6 as opposed to the 15 that the size function described, thus there were 9 columns of different types. \n",
    "    As for the descrepency between entry count and the number of rows, in the age column there are only 714 entries, meaning 177 people did not have their age recorded in the datasheet. All other numerical variables had every possible observation as a number, meaning the count was the same as the number of rows. \n",

    "    3. If there is one row with many missing elements, and at least one other with relatively few missing elements, to keep the most usable data, deleting the entire problematic column, then combing through the rest with dropna would keep the most data.\n",
    "    4. Since df.describe() only runs on numeric columns, it was safe to fully clear all other columns to remove the missing values, so I iterated through and used del on all object type columns. Afterwords only the age column had missing values, and even though dropna results in slightly (within 5%) fewer total observations, I used it over deleting to column to have more complete data for the remaining people. Before and after can be seen by running the code above.\n",

For example it would give the average fare paid by 20 year olds.\n",

    "    3. For the most part, both means were enough to answer the questions. Google search, however, required more thought when in comes to what to search, while with the chat bot copy pasting the error was usually enough. Additionally, when it comes to more context dependant errors, or sometimes even with the most simple errors (like forgetting a bracket on a print statement), google would take multiple websites to fix the error, or sometimes never have anything helpful; meanwhile copilot answered everything perfectly. For a few cases though, I prefer google search's answer. Mosly, errors that are: 1. Relatively common for one reason or another 2. Required minimal other lines of code to understand & 3. Had multiple solutions. Case A was like this, since jupyter hub sometimes caused that specific error. The reason google's answer was better in that case was because the stack overflow page that was the top result had many different possible reasons, the same thing explained in many different wordings, and some niche & potentially more helpful solutions. Essentially, it allows for more browsing of options than just one chat bot promt. Overall though, AI was the best option, as sad as it makes me to say so.  \n",

    "    1. Python Script for Dataset Size: I provided a Python script using the pandas library to load the Titanic dataset from a URL and find its size (number of rows and columns).\n",

    "    3. Summary of Dataset Columns: I shared a Python script to get a statistical summary of the numerical columns and an overview of the dataset using the describe() and info() methods in pandas.\n",

    "    1. Pandas describe Method: We discussed that std in the describe method stands for standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of a dataset.\n",
    "    2. Deleting a Column: You learned that using del df['col'] removes the specified column from the DataFrame.\n",
    "    3. Handling NaN Values: We talked about how df.dropna() removes entire rows that contain any null values by default.\n",
    "    4. GroupBy and Describe: We explored how df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() groups the DataFrame by col1 and computes descriptive statistics for col2 within each group.\n",
    "    5. Importing Pandas: You encountered an error name 'pd' is not defined, which was resolved by ensuring import pandas as pd is included at the top of your script.\n",
    "    6. HTTP Error 404: We discussed that this error indicates the server could not find the requested resource, often due to an incorrect URL.\n",
    "    7. Syntax and Typo Errors: We fixed a few syntax and typo errors in your code, such as missing parentheses in a print statement and correcting DF.describe() to df.describe().\n",
    "    8. NameError: We resolved a NameError by correctly referencing the column name as a string in the groupby method."
