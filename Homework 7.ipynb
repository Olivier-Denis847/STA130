    "- Multiple linear regression is the simple version but with several variables. It allows for deeper and more complex interpretations\n",
    "- Continuous allows for a change in the independant variable for any precice value change of the continuous varaible. For indicator variables though, you have one distinct number for whether or not a certain thing happens or not\n",
    "- Because the indicator variable only has dicrete value jumps, there ends up being multiple distinct lines when graphed\n",
    "- It creates even more interesting categories for comparisons. Maybe one varaible only has a significant impact when something else is present, interaction variables capture that idea\n",
    "- It's one distinct value based on which option was chosen. Always some intercept term, + any relevant slope term   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2:  \n",
    "Without an interaction term, the estimated outcome relies solely on how much money was spent on digital and how much money was spent on TV. An interaction term here might make more sense, since the budget might reach more new people if it's being spent in one catagory rather than the other. So instead of being linear with 2 different continuous variables, now it also grows multiplicitavely based on the ratio of the two. Using binary varaibles is simmilar, where now whether there is a discrepancy in high or low spending on either variable can be considered.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3:   \n",
    "I don't particularly want to spend that much time on a question that isn't even being marked, when I could use that time on the course project. I would pick a few arbitrary binary varaibles, fit a model, and mention the amount in log odds that each varaible would change. Also, logit(p) = ln(p/(p-1)), or p = 1/(1+e^-p), which isn't so bad, so I could interpret that. Log odds of -4 are a 1.8% chance using that formula for example.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4:   \n",
    "R squared being high would mean that nearly all datapoints follow a linear trend in our predictor variables. Meanwhile, a low p value just means that there is some non-zero effect from the predictor variables. While they do measure somewhat simmilar things, different factors can affect each statistic differently. One example is sample size. For a p value, a high sample size makes it easier to be low because the sample would need to be consistently biased by luck to still have even the slightest trend. For an R squared value, the sample size doesn't really do much in the way of affecting it's value. Also, p values are variable specific, while R squared is not, so having a few useless varialbes would only harm the R squared and not the p. In other words, even though they have simmilar ideas, it's possible to only be high in one and not the other.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5:     \n",
    "It splits the model into 2 parts, then makes 2 linear regression models with r squared values according to the test part of the dataset. The first model is hp  modeled versus attack and defence, the second one does the same but also with speed and being a legendary. Then it tests to see if the second half of the dataset also adheres to the model to affirm it's validity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6:   \n",
    "Basically, it makes very precise changes based on things that might only occur a few times, or it will account for variables that should be grouped together many times. Only training on a practice set, and allowing for so much flexibility in the intersection of variables will make something very finicky, which highly over-ajusts for certain situations. In other words, simple is better, but algorithms make complicated predictions when they can, so they tend to break.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7:    \n",
    "Model 5 and 6 both introduce a few important variables, but don't have interaction terms. This essentially solves the issues of the previous code because there's a fixed number of variables. The difference between the two is that model 5 accounts for all types and generations, while model 6 narrows it down. Stoping interaction terms, and later restricting categorical variables does make the model a lot more simple, but it's not really capturing the same ideas as the previous models, and so they won't always be useful in the same situations. Model 7 though actually keeps the interaction terms and just uses a few other tricks to reduce the multicollinearity. It has the same search narrowing as model 6 does, and it also centres and scales the data to stop some finer adjustments. It's not as good at making any model more general as model 6, but it keeps the same ideas and complex interactions as the original, but makes it actually useable.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8:   \n",
    "The last seed doesn't follow this trend for some reason, but it's basically that the more complicated models had higher correlation in the test sample, and less in the rest of the sample.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9:   \n",
    "This code is a generalization test for models 6 and 7. It tests them with smaller, then larger subsets of the data, and measures their correlation and predictive power. The results are that model 6 has consistently lower in-sample correlation, and consistently higher out-of-sample correlation. This indicates that there is some amount of overfitting within model 7, and that it suffers from low generalizability compared to model 6. Basically, because model 7 allows for more precise changes, it explains it's data very well, but nothing else, so it's nearly useless, but kinda cool.\n",

    "    Simple Linear Regression: Involves one independent variable and one dependent variable. The model is ( y = b_0 + b_1x ).\n",
